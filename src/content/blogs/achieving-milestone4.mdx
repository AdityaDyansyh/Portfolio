# Building My Portfolio with Next.js

Building a personal portfolio isn’t just about showing projects — it’s about showing how you think, structure code, and make technical decisions. I chose **Next.js** to build my portfolio because it balances performance, flexibility, and modern developer experience.

## Why Next.js?

Next.js provides features that fit perfectly for a portfolio site:
- File-based routing for clean structure
- Server-side rendering and static generation for fast loading
- Built-in optimization for images and assets
- Easy deployment with Vercel

It allowed me to focus more on content and design instead of boilerplate setup.

## The Development Process

I started by defining what the portfolio should communicate:
- Who I am as a developer  
- What I can build  
- How I think and learn  

From there, I structured the project into reusable components, kept the layout minimal, and focused on readability and performance. The blog system uses Markdown, making it easy to write, version, and maintain posts.

## Challenges Along the Way

- Designing a clean UI without overcomplicating it  
- Structuring content to be scalable  
- Balancing aesthetics with performance  

Each challenge pushed me to refine both the code and the design decisions.

## What I Learned

- **Project Structure**: Organizing components and pages cleanly  
- **Performance Awareness**: Optimizing assets and rendering  
- **Content-Driven Design**: Letting content guide the UI  
- **Consistency**: Keeping design and code aligned  

## Conclusion

This portfolio is more than a website — it’s a living project that grows as I grow. Building it with Next.js gave me a solid foundation to iterate, improve, and showcase my journey as a developer.

More features, more refinements, and more logs coming soon. 🚀
